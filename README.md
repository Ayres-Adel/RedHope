### Desktop Computers Vs Mobile Devices 

When using the RedHope platform, the mobile experience offers a significant advantage
over the desktop version—particularly when it comes to location accuracy. Here’s why:
Mobile devices are equipped with dedicated GPS hardware that communicates directly
with satellites to pinpoint your real-time location with high precision—often accurate
within a few meters. In contrast, desktop or laptop computers usually rely on IP-based
geolocation, which is far less accurate. This can result in locations being off by several
kilometers—or even placing you in a completely different city

## 📜 Dedication

This project is dedicated to:

🩸 Every volunteer donor who selflessly gives a part of themselves to save others.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Our families and friends — for their unwavering support, love, and encouragement throughout our academic journey.

🎓 Our mentors, especially Dr. Djabour Djamel — for inspiring us to combine technology with compassion in the service of humanity.

🕌 And above all, to Allah — for the strength, guidance, and blessings that made this work possible.

🙏 And for the last, I want to thank my brother and teammate, **Kellal Abdennour**.  
Without him, this work would not have been possible. His dedication, determination, and support were the backbone of this journey. I sincerely hope he achieves the best in life, and continues to grow into the remarkable person he is destined to be.
